No performance (acting, dancing, ...)!<br \/>\r\n4. Original sound (no music, ...)!<br \/>\r\n5. At least 30sec long!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMake direct cinema! Capture the life as pure as it's possible. The reality is moving enough. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSo, do we really want to see movies where nothing happens? Yes! That is life. And never \"nothing\" means \"nothing\"! There always something happens.
